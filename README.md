# mathcha
A [mathquill](http://mathquill.com/)-like interactive math input in a terminal, built with the charm TUI library.

## Supported Symbols and Commands
There is no standard support table or even a goal, but I will start with Mathquill's supported commands.

Take a look at [command_def.go](latex/command_def.go)for a list of all recognized latex commands.
